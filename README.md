## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my journey solving algorithm challenges on HackerRank using Python. The problems are categorized based on the domains they belong to, like "Sorting", "Dynamic Programming", "Greedy Algorithms", etc. As I continue solving more problems, I will update this repository.

## Solutions

This repository contains solutions to problems in various domains such as:

- **Warmup**: Basic problems to get familiar with coding.
- **Implementation**: Problems involving straightforward algorithms.
- **Data Structures**: Problems related to arrays, stacks, queues, etc.
- **Sorting**: Sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Problems involving DP concepts.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Solving problems using greedy strategies.
- **Graph Theory**: Problems involving graph traversal and related algorithms.

### Example Problem: `Palindrome Check`
- **Problem Link**: [[HackerRank Problem URL](https://www.hackerrank.com/)]
- **Difficulty**: Easy

**Solution**:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
