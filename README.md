## 💻 Usage

You can run any of the solutions using Python 3:

bash
```
python problem-name.py
```

Example:

python A-Very-Big-Sum.py


Make sure to provide any required input as per the HackerRank problem description.

##🧪 Example Problem: Palindrome Check

This is just a demonstration of how solutions are structured.

Problem Link: HackerRank

Difficulty: Easy

# Problem: Palindrome Check
# Check if a given string is a palindrome

def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

# Example usage:
print(is_palindrome("level"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))  # Output: False
