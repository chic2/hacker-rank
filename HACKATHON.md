##Question:
-
Fred was once an olympic marathon gold medalist, and desires that his two children will one day become gold medalists just like him. He decided to train his two children Beck (15 years old) and Romeo (7 years old) by setting up a race competition between them using the well calibrated 6,000metres race track at his backyard. The track has 1,001 checkpoints, each at 6metres distant from each other. The first checkpoint is at the beginning (i.e position 0) on the track.

To make the race interesting and arguably fair, he made up his mind that Romeo and Beck will not have the same starting point. For all the runs, if Beck starts from ith checkpoint (i > 0), then Romeo will start from the jth checkpoint (j > i) on the track, and both Romeo and Beck will commence the race at the same time once he blows the whistle.

Assumption:
A. For any distance P covered by Romeo , Beck covers a distance of 2P within the same time on the race track..
B. The race will end as a draw if Romeo and Beck should get to the same checkpoint at the same time, otherwise anyone who get to the end of the track first wins the race.
